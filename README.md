Learning tutorial for my gf to finally learn PYTHON (and whoever wants to learn python)

Open a terminal and run the *'run.py'* in separate window. 

For complete beginners, the command should generaly look like this
```
python ./path/to/run.py
```
Of course replace the path/to with actual path or you can navigate in this folder
and just use ./run.py
The command can also be 'python3' on some other operating systems
Oh and you have to also install python.
Just google it, you are smart...
