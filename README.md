A simple learning tutorial to help my girlfriend — and anyone else who wants to learn Python.

Before you begin, make sure Python is installed on your system. If you need to install it, search for "install Python" and follow the official instructions for your operating system.

To run the project:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder (use the `cd` command).
2. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows (PowerShell):
```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
- On Windows (cmd):
```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
- On macOS / Linux:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the program in a separate terminal window:
```
python ./run.py
```
6. Do what the program tells you
7. Have fun!

Note: On some Linux/macOS systems the `python` command may be `python3`. Use whichever command runs Python 3 on your machine.
