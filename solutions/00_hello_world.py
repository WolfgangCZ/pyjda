# hellouky smouky
# welcolme to most magnificient python course of all time
# and prepare to become the best python programmer in the world and beyond!

# first as a real programmer, do you know what should you start with?
# if course its hello world!
# so my first task for you is to print out "hello world" and run the code

# BUT there is a catch
# since i want you to become the best python programmer in the world
# and not just some garbage beta python vibe coder or whatever
# i dont want you to run the code in using vscode or whatever editor
# run it using the command line

# have fun

print("Hello world!")

# command: 'python ./00_hello_world.py' or 'python3 ./00_hello_world/hello_world.py'
# depends on the directary where you opened you terminal
