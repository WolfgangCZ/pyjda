Have you ever dreamed of becoming a programmer? Did you think its impossible?
Its too hard? Its not for you? That you dont have the brains?

Have you ever been stuck in a loop of looking for the best python course available
and couldnt decide which one you go for?

Well i have the solution for you!
This is it. This is the one, the only, the most magnificient python course
that will make you the best python programmer in the world and beyond!

Are you ready?
Ok lets do it!

First as a real programmer, do you know what should you start with?
if course its a Hello world! What else should it be dummy?

So my first task for you is to print out "hello world" and run the code
The way you do it is using the function print()

In python, writing the code is super easy, if i wanted to print out "hovno"
it would look like this:

print("hovno")

Thats it, no semicolons, no curly braces, etc.

When you run it, you should see in you terminal "hovno"


There is a catch though:
Since I want you to become the best python programmer in the world
and not just some garbage beta python vibe coder or whatever
I dont want you to run the code using some vscode or whatever code editor shortcut

Run it using the command line

When you want to run the code, you run it command like "pyhon ./path/to/file.py" ok?
Its not that hard

And for the love of all living things, dont use AI to solve tasks in this course
becuase that way you will learn absolutely nothing...

Have fun
