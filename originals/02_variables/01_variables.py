# TODO 1: create variable called 'age' and store your age in it as an integer


# TODO 2: create variable called 'name' and store your name in it as a string


# TODO 3: create variable called 'height' and store your height in it as a float
# hint: you dont have to usually specify the type of the variable, python will figure it out
# BUT if you wont to create float number, you should type it like with
# decimal point (for example: 1.0), otherwise, python might think it is an integer


# TODO 4: create variable called 'is_married' and store your marital status in it as a boolean
