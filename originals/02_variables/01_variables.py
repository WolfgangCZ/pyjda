"""
Since you are now gigachad alpha five-head python hello-world-print-master, 
lets move on some easier stuff.

As you probably guessed, we now learn a thing or two about variables.
What are variables i hear you say?
Variables are kind of storages for data under some name.
For example i can create a variable called 'ten' and store the number 10 in it
or we can create variable called 'hello_world' and store the string 'hello world' in it.
(string is a collection of characters if you didnt know it)

It would look like this:

ten = 10
hello_world = "hello world"

Thats it, no semicolons, no curly braces, etc.

Now if we wanted to print out hello world again, we can use the variable hello_world like this:

print(hello_world)

We divide variables by their type, in our case 'ten' is an integer and 'hello_world' is a string.

These are the main types of variables in python:
int (integer): stores whole numbers, examples: -1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 50, 10000
float: stores real numbers, examples: -1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.00001
string: stores text, examples: "hello", "world", "hello world", " ", 'asfh!0'
bool: stores true or false values, examples: True, False (these are the only ones you can use)

We do have other types of variables, but we will get to them later.

Now lets try it out!
"""

# TODO 1: create variable called 'age' and store your age in it as an integer

# TODO 2: create variable called 'name' and store your name in it as a string

# TODO 3: create variable called 'height' and store your height in it as a float
# hint: you dont have to usually specify the type of the variable, python will figure it out
# BUT if you wont to create float number, you should type it like with
# decimal point (for example: 1.0), otherwise, python might think it is an integer

# TODO 4: create variable called 'is_married' and store your marital status in it as a boolean
